> An important concept to understand first is that every single element on a web page is a block. Literally a rectangle of pixels. This is easy to understand when you set the element to display: block; or if that element is block-level by default like a `<div>` . This means you can set a width and a height and that element will respect that. But elements that are display: inline; , like a `<span>` by default, are also rectangles, they just flow onto the page differently, lining up horizontally as they can.

Before jumping in the Async JavaScript world, make sure you understand what **JSON** is, we use it A LOT to consume and transmit data.

### Example

``` json
{
  "students": [ 
     { 
        "id":"102", 
        "name": "Douglas", 
        "lastname": "Crockford" 
     }, 
     { 
        "id":"103", 
        "name": "Nick", 
        "lastname": "Johnson" 
     } 
  ]   
}
```

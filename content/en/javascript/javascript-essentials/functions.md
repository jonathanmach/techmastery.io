A JavaScript function is a block of code designed to perform a particular task. For a function to be executed, something needs to invoke it (call it).

### Basic example

``` javascript
// Example of a JavaScript function that greets a person

// 1. Declare/create the function
function greetUser(userName) {
    // code to be executed
    return 'Hi ' + userName + ', nice to have you here!'
}

// 2. Invoke the function, passing a parameter
greetUser('John')
// Data returned by the function:
"Hi John, nice to have you here!"
```

`create-react-app` is an official React tool that lets you easily create your project and focus on the code straight away, without having to configure build tools.

Assuming you already have Node.js installed, run: 

``` bash
npm install -global create-react-app 
```

Now, to create a new React app:

``` bash
npx create-react-app project_name

Another must-have extension, in my opnion, that will save you a lot of time!

Created by Sarah Drasner and beautifully summarized by herself in the project repository:

<link-bookmark href="https://github.com/sdras/vue-vscode-snippets" title="sdras/vue-vscode-snippets">This repo was built particularly for real world use. It doesn't catalogue the API definitions, and it's not a kitchen sink approach. Rather, it focuses on developer ergonomics from the point of Vue of real world use. Included are the pieces I personally get sick of typing, have to keep looking up, or forget to consider while developing that I make more use of when they're at my fingertips.</link-bookmark>

Rule of thumb: be open-minded about frameworks! Experiment with more than one so that you're able to understand how they work, their similarities and how they differ.

You will eventually find the one you identify best with but it's really common to see professional developers ending up proficient in more than one framework. They are able to work with different technologies depending on the project they're working on.

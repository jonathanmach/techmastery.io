From the official docs:

> When building apps with a bundler, the JavaScript bundle can become quite large, and thus affect the page load time. It would be more efficient if we can split each route's components into a separate chunk, and only load them when the route is visited. - [Vue Router docs](https://router.vuejs.org/guide/advanced/lazy-loading.html)

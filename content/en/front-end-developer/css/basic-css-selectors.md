Learn how to target your HTML elements so that you can apply styles to them. For example, if you wanted every paragraph in your page to be red, you would write:

``` css
p {
    color: red
}
```

In this case, `p` is the selector that will target every paragraph element on the page. 

At this point, focus on learning the most basic CSS selectors. We will tackle more advanced selectors later on in this module.

Basic CSS selectors you need to know:

* Universal Selector
* Element Selector
* Class Selector
* ID Selectors

You have to think about what elements on your page you want to target and how to write rules that cleanly target and apply CSS styling to those elements.

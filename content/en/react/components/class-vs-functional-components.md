## Functional Components

Functional components are also commonly referred to as stateless components.

<link-bookmark href="https://programmingwithmosh.com/react/react-functional-components/" title="React Functional or Class Components: Everything you need to know">"The general heuristic I use is to always start with a functional component. If you find out you need lifecycle methods or it makes sense to have a small piece component level state, itâ€™s trivial to refactor to a class component. I find this style of writing components keeps me from getting lazy and forces me to use functional components to their full potential."</link-bookmark>
